    <p>This site provides SQL queries and a demo hospital database.Welcome to Group 3's Hospital database project! The project demonstrated the development of a comprehensive and fully functional hospital management system with a database covering such important aspects as hospital details, doctor and patient information, prescriptions, drugs, diseases, appointments and laboratory test results. 
       Our project supports complex SQL queries and enables advanced data retrieval and analysis using Microsoft Access and MySQL, respectively.
       Explore the project files, ERD diagrams, and SQL queries to understand how we have built this dynamic database system.
